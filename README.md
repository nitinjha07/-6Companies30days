# #6Companies30days Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the **#6Companies30days** challenge! üéâ  
This repository is dedicated to solving 15 questions every 5 days, over a span of 30 days, to strengthen my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills. The problems are carefully selected from top tech companies like **Amazon**, **Microsoft**, **Walmart**, **Google**, **Atlassian**, and **Goldman Sachs**, and are commonly asked in coding interviews and online assessments.


## How I Organized the Repo

Each set of questions will be stored in its corresponding folder. I will update the repository regularly with solutions to the problems from the challenge. Each folder will contain:
- Code files for each problem solved (in preferred programming language: C++, Java, Python, etc.)
- Descriptions, approaches, or comments to explain the thought process behind solving the problems.

## Challenge Details

The challenge aims to prepare participants for real-world coding interviews and build skills necessary to ace technical assessments. By following this challenge, I'll be able to:
- Strengthen my problem-solving abilities.
- Learn new data structures and algorithms.
- Prepare for my upcoming interviews.

## My Progress

You can follow my progress here in this repository. I'll be committing solutions regularly as I move through the 30-day journey.
